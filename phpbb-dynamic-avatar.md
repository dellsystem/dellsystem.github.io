This MOD provides the ability to edit your avatar, using bodily features and clothes that can be purchased or acquired. In the vein of 2.0x MODs like Live Avatar and Nulavatar, and the dynamic avatar capabilities of the 3.0x MOD Camorea Suite. Useful for RPG forums.

Although not required, the Ultimate Points MOD by femu and Wuerzi is supported by this MOD, allowing the admin to set prices for items.

Additionally, although some sample images are provided for you to test out the MOD, a comprehensive set of avatar and clothing images is not included; you will need to acquire those images yourself, hopefully legally.

## Features

* Everything is controlled from the ACP
* MOD includes sample images, items and layers for you to play with to get the hang of things
* Integration with [Ultimate Points MOD](http://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/ultimate_points/), so that items can be purchasable

### Planned

* Integration with [genders MOD](http://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/genders/)
