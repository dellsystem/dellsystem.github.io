I'm Wendy, and I'm an undergraduate Math and Computer Science student at
McGill University. You may know me as:

* Lead developer for and prolific contributor to [Wikinotes] (since 2010)
* Someone who occasionally gives tech talks for events or organisations like
  [ConFoo 2014][confoo_talk], [HackMcGill's Hack 101s][hack101_talks], and
  [PyLadies meetups][pyladies_talk] (you can find my slides on [speakerdeck],
  and their source on [GitHub][slides])
* Former website and moderator team member at [phpBB.com]
  (2007–2014)
* USG-IT for [SSUNS 2011], [McMUN 2013] and [McMUN 2014]
* Former webmaster for [McGill's Computer Taskforce][ctf] (2011–2012)
* Past developer of [diva.js] while working at [DDMAL] (2011–2012)
* Past developer of [Agora Octave] for the European Space Agency's "Summer of
  Code in Space" (2012)
* Former student researcher in the [Network Dynamics lab] (2011–2014)
* That person with the weird username who may or may not be sponsored by
  Dell (I wish)
* Someone who tried for a really long commit streak but who fell off at [170
  days][github]
* Owner of various incredibly frivolous domains, including [airdoge.com],
  [out-of-ten.com], [interrobangwithfriends.com], and [howdoi.land]

Below you can find some things I've recently written (you can find the rest
under [archives](/archives)). You can also learn more [about me](/about) or
[about my projects](/projects).

Want to ask me about any of my projects or just say hi? Send me a message on
Twitter [@dellsystem](https://twitter.com/dellsystem), or check out my [about
page](/about#contact) for other contact options. You could also take the
opportunity to tell me how awesome I am, but don't worry, I already know.

_(I'm not actually this egotistical in person, I swear)_
