I'm Wendy Liu, and I'm currently completing a [one-year masters program on
inequality][personal statement] at the London School of Economics. I'm also a
software developer: I interned at Google in 2013 and was all set for a software

This website is primarily a place to showcase my [art](/art), my [code](/code),
and my [words](/words). I also maintain [a list of the complete works of David
Foster Wallace](/dfw). If you want to get in touch, find me on Twitter

page](/about) for other contact options. You should also add me on
[Goodreads]---I'm in the midst of a 208-book reading challenge this year, so
you'll get to watch me struggle with that in real time.
