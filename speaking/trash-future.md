title: "Abolish Silicon Valley, for TrashFuture"
---

On July 7, 2018, I recorded an episode of TrashFuture (a left comedy podcast on tech and politics). This episode, which was released July 16, was also titled "Abolish Silicon Valley", just like the show I did for Novara [last month](/conversations/abolish-silicon-valley). What can I say; I just really like talking about abolishing Silicon Valley.

You can listen to the episode on whatever podcast app you use, or in your browser: [Abolish Silicon Valley feat. Wendy Liu](https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/e/abolish-silicon-valley-feat-wendy-liu/)

A warning for the unwary: this podcast is decidedly a _comedy_ podcast, so if you're listening because you want to hear about the tech industry and not because you love esoteric Twitter jokes about football coming home, you might want to skip ahead a bit. Some rough topic markers:

* 6 mins to 9 mins: me explaining what I'm doing here, on the left, insofar as anyone can explain such a thing
* 10 mins to 13 mins: how the left needs to incorporate more perspectives from within the tech industry
* 13 mins onward: on the prospects of building worker power in the tech industry, and the roadblocks along the way (mostly ideological, stemming from this concept of "meritocracy")
* got sick of hearing the sound of my own voice so you're on your own from here, sorry

Also, here's a clip of me trying to work out what abolishing Silicon Valley means in real time, near the end:

If I could do some post-production editing to make that more eloquent, I would explain it like this:

> "Abolishing Silicon Valley" doesn't mean nuking the region. The goal is to restructure society in such a way that the worst excesses of Silicon Valley _are no longer possible_. And that requires a fundamental transformation of our economy. We have to recognise that the problems we see with Silicon Valley didn't just come out of nowhere; instead, the tech industry is more like a microcosm that amplifies the existing problems with capitalism. So if we want to change that, we'll have to challenge the roots of the problem, which really means challenging capitalism.
