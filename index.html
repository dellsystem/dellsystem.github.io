        <p>My debut book, <em><a href="https://abolishsiliconvalley.com/">Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology From Capitalism</a></em>, a memoir/manifesto about the tech industry, was published in 2020 by <a href="https://repeaterbooks.com/">Repeater Books</a>.</p>
        <p>I've also written a variety of shorter essays about technology and
        politics, among other things. You can find more of my writing <a
        href="/writing">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I am currently working on a novel, as well as an ongoing column about tech billboards in San Francisco for Bay Area Current (linked below).</p>
