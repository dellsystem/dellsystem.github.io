<div class="triple-grid">
    <div class="doubled column" style="padding-right: 15px">
        <p>My debut book, <em><a href="https://abolishsiliconvalley.com/">Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology From Capitalism</a></em>, a memoir/manifesto about the tech industry, was published in 2020 by <a href="https://repeaterbooks.com/">Repeater Books</a>.</p>
        <p>I am currently working on a novel, as well as an <a href="https://bayareacurrent.com/the-billboards-arent-for-you/">ongoing column about tech billboards</a> in San Francisco for <a href="https://bayareacurrent.com">Bay Area Current</a>.</p>
        <p>I've also written a variety of shorter essays about technology and politics, among other things. You can find more of my writing <a href="/writing">here</a>.</p>
