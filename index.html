        <h3>Hi! I'm Wendy Liu, and I live in San Francisco.</h3>
        <h4>I'm a writer with a background in software engineering.</h4>
        <p>My debut book, <em><a href="https://abolishsiliconvalley.com/">Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology From Capitalism</a></em>, a memoir/manifesto about the tech industry, was published in 2020 by <a href="https://repeaterbooks.com/">Repeater Books</a>.</p>
        <p>I've also written a variety of shorter essays about technology and politics, among other things. You can find more of my writing <a href="/writing">here</a>. I am currently working on a novel.</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm being selective about speaking and writing opportunities. If we don't already know each other, and it's not paid, I probably won't be able to do it. Thank you for understanding.</p>
