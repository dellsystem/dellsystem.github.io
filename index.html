        <p>My debut book, <em><a href="https://abolishsiliconvalley.com/">Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology From Capitalism</a></em>, a memoir/manifesto about the tech industry, was published in 2020 by <a href="https://repeaterbooks.com/">Repeater Books</a>.</p>
        <p>I've also written a variety of shorter essays about technology and
        politics, among other things. You can find more of my writing <a
        href="/writing">here</a>. I am currently working on a novel.</p>
        <p>You can get in touch with me via email (ilostwaldo@gmail.com), Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dellsystem">@dellsystem</a>), or Instagram (also <a href="https://instagram.com/dellsystem">@dellsystem</a>). For press inquiries relating to the book, please contact enquiries@repeaterbooks.com.</p>
        <p>I'm being selective about speaking/writing opportunities at the
        moment. If we don't know each other, and it's not paid, I probably
        won't do it. Thanks for understanding.</p>
