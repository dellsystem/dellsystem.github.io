projects:
- [['bookmarker', 'http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me'], "2017-present: A personal
  project I've been working on to help me retain information from all the books
  I've been reading. Currently running at
  [bookmarker.dellsystem.me](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me) for
  my own use only but I'd love to expand it into a free tool that anyone can
  use. [Source code on Github](https://github.com/dellsystem/bookmarker)
  (MIT license)"]
- [['macromeasures', 'http://macromeasures.com'], "2014--present: CTO and
  co-founder. Our stack: Python (Celery, Flask); Redis; Riak; MongoDB; AWS."]
- [['citelibre', 'http://ctlibre.com'], "2013--2014: As the IT Director for
  [ctlibre.com](http://ctlibre.com), a web-based revival of the Canadian
  publication Cité Libre founded in 1950, I built and managed the Django-based
  website. Though fairly simple in scope compared to some of my past Django
  projects, the requirements of multilingual support (English and French) and a
  mobile-responsive, user-friendly design presented fun challenges."]
- [['mcmun2014', 'https://github.com/dellsystem/mcmun-2014'], "2013--2014:
  Reprising my role as the Undersecretary–General, IT for McMUN 2014, I
  improved the system I had built for McMUN 2013 and overhauled the website
  design, complete with a new logo for McMUN's 25th anniversary. Everything is
  [available on GitHub](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/mcmun-2014)."]
- [['mcmun2013', 'https://github.com/dellsystem/mcmun-2013'], "2012--2013: As
  the Undersecretary–General, IT for the 2013 edition of this university-level
  UN conference at McGill, I again redesigned the site and built a custom
  content management system, this time with Django. The source is again
  [available on GitHub](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/mcmun-2013)."]
- [['agora', 'http://dellsystem.me/posts/socis-2012-with-octave/'], "2012: I
  worked on [Agora Octave](http://agora.octave.org/), a code submission and
  collaboration website for [Octave](http://octave.org)-related projects, as
  part of the European Space Agency's [Summer of Code in Space
  2012](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2012/). I wrote some [blog
  posts](/words#agora) about my work."]
- [['networkdynamics', 'http://networkdynamics.org/'], "2011--2014: As a student
  researcher in the [Network Dynamics Lab](http://networkdynamics.org/) (part
  of McGill University's School of Computer Science), I wrote code, ran
  experiments, and analysed data, mostly in the field of demographic inference
  with regard to Twitter. I also created the interface for [a visualisation of
  Christmas wishes on Twitter](http://xmas2012.networkdynamics.org); before
  that, I designed the interface for [an interactive visualisation of the 2012
  US presidential election, in tweets](http://election.networkdynamics.org/)."]
- [['ssuns', 'https://www.github.com/dellsystem/ssuns-2011'], "2011: As the
  Undersecretary–General, IT for the 2011 edition of this high school Model
  United Nations conference at McGill, I redesigned the site and built a
  content management and registration system around phpBB. The source is
  [available on GitHub](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/ssuns-2011), though
  the usefulness of the repository is limited to historical value, as the site
  no longer uses that codebase (and, to be honest, it was pretty awful)."]
- [['diva', 'http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/diva'], "2011--2012: diva.js is an
  open source document viewer for high-resolution scanned documents,
  particularly old sheet music, that was designed for high performance. There's
  a frontend component (a jQuery plugin), and a backend component for
  processing and displaying the images. I was hired as a web app developer by
  the DDMAL lab in McGill's Department of Music Technology in February 2011,
  and thus became the primary developer of diva.js until I left the lab in
  August 2012. The project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js);
  you can also find out more about it through [the project
  website.](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/diva)"]
- [['ctf', 'http://taskforce.sus.mcgill.ca'], "2011--2013: As a volunteer for
  Computer Taskforce – a student-run group that manages substantial printing
  and computing resources for science students at McGill – I fixed a lot of
  print jams and built an external website for the group. The website was built
  with Jekyll and the Twitter bootstrap and uses a server-side script for
  checking printer status. As usual, the source is [available on
  github](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/ctf-website)."]
- [['wikinotes', 'http://www.wikinotes.ca'], "2010--present: A free, unofficial
  wiki-based resource for the courses at McGill University. Founded by McGill
  students in the fall of 2010, Wikinotes began life as a MediaWiki
  installation containing student-contributed lecture notes, study guides, and
  sample test questions. I joined a few months afterwards to help manage the
  MediaWiki installation, but after a semester of fighting with MediaWiki to
  make it more usable for our purposes, I gave up and built a [custom platform
  for Wikinotes using Django](https://github.com/dellsystem/wikinotes). I've
  since graduated from McGill, and though I no longer actively develop features
  or write course content, I manage the hosting and check up on it every now
  and then to see if everything still works. Creation of new content has
  unfortunately slowed to a crawl since I and some other contributors left
  McGill, but I'm told that the existing material is still helpful for students
  during exam period. [Check it out for yourself](http://wikinotes.ca) if you
  like."]
- [['phpBB', '/phpbb'], "2007--2014: phpBB is a popular open source bulletin
  board system written, as you might expect, in PHP. I first joined the core
  team as a moderator in October 2007, and was added to the website team in
  July 2011. Although I resigned from both teams in March 2014 due to other
  commitments and the fact that I no longer manage any phpBB-based websites,
  I'll forever be grateful to the community that introduced me to worlds of
  open source and web development. Over the years, I've built [a few phpBB
  MODifications](/phpbb) as well; I'm not actively developing them anymore, but
  feel free to [contact me](/about#contact) if you have support queries or want
  to take over development."]
