if i had to sum myself up in 3 bullet points
--------------------------------------------

* a sucker for [reading challenges](posts/a-year-of-200-books)
* transitioning from [being in tech](/code) to [writing about tech](/writing)
* extremely left-wing politics with a mildly [accelerationist] bent

things people rarely ask about
------------------------------

* **favourite pokemon**: mudkip, as you may have heard
* **how I make slides**: I have a complicated setup involving an
  open source tool called [Inkscape Slide]; it's an exceptionally painful process
  which I would not recommend to anyone and which may explain why I haven't
  given a talk in a while (you can see some of my slides on [speakerdeck], with
  their source on [github][slides])
* **most popular blog post**: [this (regretfully) snarky one][d2l] about some
  questionable code that I found in my university's learning management system,
  Desire2Learn; the blog post found its way to #1 on Hacker News while I was
  asleep, the fallout of which affirmed the merits of using a static site
  generator to build this website
* **the story behind my username**: there's no cool story; it was meant to be a
  throwaway username that I used for phpBB.com at the age of 12 (I was using a
  Dell computer at the time). I ended up spending a lot more time in that
  community that I expected and so the username kind of stuck with me. I have
  since come to terms with "dellsystem" and will even answer to "dell".

random technical details
------------------------

* **currently running**: ubuntu 18.04
* **favourite text editor**: vim for the command line, gedit otherwise; IDEs
  tend to crash in my presence
* **favourite free software projects**: [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org),
  [django](http://www.djangoproject.com),
  [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
  [semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com),
  [mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/)
* **programming languages**: primarily python; in the past, I've done PHP, javascript, java, some C, a bit of
  ruby, a modicum of objective-j, very little bash, and more MIPS assembly than
  I'll ever need
* **other technologies I may know something about**: HTML, CSS, LaTeX, SQL, jQuery,
  AngularJS, D3.js, supervisor, Riak, Redis, MongoDB, AWS, nginx

my programming origin story
---------------------------

I started building websites when I was 12, making heavy use of the popular
Copy and Paste Code From Other Websites method. My first few websites were
cheesy and terrible so I'll spare you the details, but one website was popular
enough that I found myself managing a small but vibrant community of users,
using the open source bulletin board software [phpBB](http://phpbb.com). As a
result, I spent a lot of time in the phpBB support forums, and eventually
picked up enough web dev knowledge to start answering other people's support
questions---not always accurately, but it was a great way to learn.

I no longer run any phpBB boards, but I owe much of my current interest in
computer science to that community, which welcomed me aboard as a
moderator---and, later, as a member of the website team---even though I was a
clueless 15-year-old who had only just found out what Linux was. My early
programming experiences consisted of modifying phpBB installations, which was
probably not the best way to learn PHP, but I persevered and eventually
discovered languages that are not PHP.

In 2014, I graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Science in
Mathematics and Computer Science. I still make cheesy and terrible websites on
occasion, like when I [registered the domain howdoi.land to show a perpetually
flying martlet using CSS animations][howdoi.land] (still one of my proudest
accomplishments). These days, though, I don't have much time to write code; the
code I do write is primarily for [a personal project designed to help me retain
information from the books I read](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me), so I
haven't animated any martlets in a while.

email newsletters i subscribe to
--------------------------------

I subscribe to a ton of email newsletters covering a mix of tech, econ, culture, and politics, on substack and other platforms. It gets a little overwhelming at times - keeping up with all this content is almost a full-time job - but it's a good way to stay up-to-date with what's going on in the world.

* [Amazon Chronicles](https://amazonchronicles.substack.com/): a terrific in-depth newsletter focused on what's going on at Amazon, by writer Tim Carmody.
* [Benedict's newsletter](https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter): a weekly newsletter on the tech industry from Benedict Evans, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz. As you can expect, it's not the most critical perspective, but it's chock-full of interesting tidbits about what's going on in the industry.
* [Brave New World of Work](https://tinyletter.com/mdbergfeld): a weekly link round-up on "worker organizing, the wider labour movement and the world of work" from researcher Mark Bergfeld.
* [Exponential View](https://exponentialview.substack.com/): a weekly (and extremely packed) newsletter run by Azeem Azhar, Senior Advisor on AI to the CTIO of Accenture. Covers tech and econ news in a pretty straightforward way, though it's sympathetic to critical views of the tech industry.
* [David Beer Newsletter](https://davidbeer.substack.com/): technology, media and culture from a UK-based sociology prof.
* [Griefbacon](https://griefbacon.substack.com/): miscellaneous writing by Helena Fitzgerald, an extremely talented contemporary writer who specialises in personal essays. I came across her work through [her essay on The National](https://nylon.com/articles/national-sleep-well-beast-everything-is-embarrassing) in _NYLON_, which I've re-read maybe a dozen times since it first came out and which still gives me chills even now.
* [Hack The Union](http://www.hacktheunion.org): a weekly link round-up on "the future of worker organising" by Kati Sipp, who has been involved with various US unions including SEIU.
* [Internal exile](https://tinyletter.com/robhorning): a weekly column by Rob Horning, editor for _Real Life_ and _The New Inquiry_. Thoughtful musings on "social media, consumerism, and how these affect sociality, identity, subjectivity", with a bit of an academic slant.
* [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine): "a daily roundup on all things Wall Street and finance from Bloomberg Viewʼs Matt Levine". It's definitely oriented to a business audience, not a left one, but it's surprisingly critical and accessible all the same. Expect several thousands words in your inbox Monday-Friday. [Here's a fun piece on high-frequency trading](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-11/you-need-a-big-tower-to-trade-stocks), which also includes the lovely line, "the problem here is capitalism, not Wells Fargo".
* [Off Leash](https://liaruss.substack.com/): SF-focused newsletter by Lia Russ, freelance writer & activist with DSA SF who also writes about labor for SF weekly.
* [Oversharing](https://oversharing.substack.com): an extremely in-depth and well-researched weekly newsletter about the sharing economy, run by _Quartz_ reporter Ali Griswold.
* [Radical Urbanist](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radicalurbanist): a weekly round-up of urban tech and liveable cities with a global (and socialist) perspective, written by Paris Marx.
* [Richard Seymour's patreon](https://www.patreon.com/richardseymourwtf): original writing (usually sent out multiple times a week) from a UK-based writer on politics and culture. Worth the $3+ a month.
* [Tech Workers Coalition newsletter](https://techworkerscoalition.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe): an extremely good weekly round-up of links relevant to labour organising in the tech industry. Does not mince words. Also lists upcoming TWC-related events happening around the world (US-centric).
* [Tricontinental newsletter](https://www.thetricontinental.org/): Indian historian and Marxist theorist Vijay Prashad runs the weekly newsletter for "Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research", which takes a wonderfully internationalist perspective on economic matters. Passionate and polemical without sacrificing intellectual rigour.
* [TheLitCritGuy's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/TheLitCritGuy): original writing on literary theory and contemporary culture, starting from $1 a month.
* [The Baffler newsletter](https://thebaffler.com/about/newsletter): a link round-up of recent articles from _The Baffler_, an online and print magazine which bills itself as "America’s leading voice of interesting and unexpected left-wing political criticism, cultural analysis, short stories, poems and art".
* [the collected ahp](https://annehelen.substack.com): miscellaneous writing by Anne Helen Peterson, the BuzzFeed reporter who wrote the canonical piece on [millennial burnout](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work).
* [The Margins](https://themargins.substack.com): a group blog by Can Duruk and Ranjan Roy, covering the business of tech and the tech of business. Very thoughtful analysis getting into the weeds of business models of tech companies.
