interests
---------

* command lines, clean code, and consonance
* [reading books](http://goodreads.com/dellsystem), especially critical theory
  and literary fiction featuring gorgeous prose, à la David Foster Wallace
* an unusual physical fitness trinity of powerlifting, contemporary dance, and
  artistic gymnastics
* extremely left-wing politics with an [accelerationist] bent

miscellaneous
-------------

* **currently running**: ubuntu 16.04
* **favourite pokemon**: mudkip, as you may have heard
* **favourite text editor**: vim for the command line, gedit otherwise; IDEs
  tend to crash in my presence
* **favourite free software projects**: [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org),
  [django](http://www.djangoproject.com),
  [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
  [semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com),
  [mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/)
* **programming languages**: python, PHP, javascript, java, some C, a bit of
  ruby, a modicum of objective-j, very little bash, more MIPS assembly than
  I'll ever need, and [a functional language you've probably never heard of and
  likely will never encounter again](http://www.smlnj.org "pretty cool though")
* **other technologies I may know something about**: HTML, CSS, LaTeX, SQL, jQuery,
  AngularJS, D3.js, supervisor, Riak, Redis, MongoDB, AWS, nginx
* **how I make slides**: I have a complicated setup involving an
  open source tool called [Inkscape Slide]; it's an exceptionally painful process
  which I would not recommend to anyone and which may explain why I haven't
  given a talk in a while (you can see some of my slides on [speakerdeck], with
  their source on [github][slides])
* **most popular blog post**: [this (regretfully) snarky one][d2l] about some
  questionable code that I found in my university's learning management system,
  Desire2Learn; the blog post found its way to #1 on Hacker News while I was
  asleep, the fallout of which affirmed the merits of using a static site
  generator to build this website
* **the story behind my username**: there's no cool story; it was meant to be a
  throwaway username that I used for phpBB.com at the age of 12 (I was using a
  Dell computer at the time). I ended up spending a lot more time in that
  community that I expected and so the username kind of stuck with me. I have
  since come to terms with "dellsystem" and will even answer to "dell".

my programming origin story
---------------------------

I started building websites when I was 12, making heavy use of the popular
Copy and Paste Code From Other Websites method. My first few websites were
cheesy and terrible so I'll spare you the details, but one website was popular
enough that I found myself managing a small but vibrant community of users,
using the open source bulletin board software [phpBB](http://phpbb.com). As a
result, I spent a lot of time in the phpBB support forums, and eventually
picked up enough web dev knowledge to start answering other people's support
questions---not always accurately, but it was a great way to learn.

I no longer run any phpBB boards, but I owe much of my current interest in
computer science to that community, which welcomed me aboard as a
moderator---and, later, as a member of the website team---even though I was a
clueless 15-year-old who had only just found out what Linux was. My early
programming experiences consisted of modifying phpBB installations, which was
probably not the best way to learn PHP, but I persevered and eventually
discovered languages that are not PHP.

In 2014, I graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Science in
Mathematics and Computer Science. I still make cheesy and terrible websites on
occasion, like when I [registered the domain howdoi.land to show a perpetually
flying martlet using CSS animations][howdoi.land] (still one of my proudest
accomplishments). These days, though, I don't have much time to write code; the
code I do write is primarily for [a personal project designed to help me retain
information from the books I read](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me), so I
haven't animated any martlets in a while.
