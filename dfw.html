title: The complete works of David Foster Wallace
---

<p><em>Last updated January 29, 2022</em></p>

<p>
    If you're looking for a guide to reading the complete works of David Foster
    Wallace, you've come to the right place. I've collected a list of all the
    books and uncollected pieces I know about, as well as published transcripts
    of interviews with him. Some pieces are available on the Internet; I'm only
    going to link to the version made available by the official publisher, if
    such a thing exists, to lower the chance of broken links. Otherwise, you're
    on your own.
</p>

<p>
    I couldn't have made this list on my own and so I am indebted to everyone
    who has compiled a list in this vein before me. All I did was combine
    existing lists, update them to take new publications into account, and add
    a visual element. For reference, I used the following:

<p>
    I made this page because all the other lists I found were years out of date
    and I wanted to gather an up-to-date version for my own personal use
    anyway. Hope you find it useful. Feel free to <a

        <p>
            A novel that was originally written for his undergraduate honors thesis
            in English at Amherst College. Kind of hard to explain ... it's a very
            strange book, and DFW has described it as a dialogue between
            Wittgenstein and Derrida, but don't let that put you off; it's ton of
            fun, and you can see him start to develop his writing style.

        <p>A non-fiction collaboration with Mark Costello, who was his college
        roommate. About the history and significance of rap, with an emphasis
        on the local (Boston) angle. Not really a must-read unless you're a

        <p>A non-fiction book about infinity (within the context of

        <p>Published posthumously. Contains his honors thesis for his
        <em>other</em> major, philosophy: a highly specific rebuttal to
        philospher Richard Taylor's 1962 proposal on determinism. The thesis
        itself is quite short; the bulk of this book contains emails and other
        academic writing from some scholars in the field. This is another one
        that's hard to justify reading unless you're a huge DFW fan or just
        really into arcane mathematical logic.</p>

            In 1996, David Lipsky spent five days with David Foster Wallace on
            behalf on <em>Rolling Stone</em>, most of them on the road. The
            piece was never actually published in <em>Rolling Stone</em>, and
            it was only after his death that it was made into a book. It's also
            been made into a movie called <a

        Lots of overlap with the previous one but much shorter: of the six

        <p>An interview with Bryan A. Garner, whose book "Garner's Modern
        American Usage" was the subject of a glowing review in DFW's
        <a href="#authority">Authority and American Usage</a>. It's a very
        short book (146 pages in my copy, but with VERY large text and tons of
        whitespace), with an extended foreword by Garner (written after
        Wallace's death), and it focuses primarily on writing/language.
        I personally thought it was worth getting, but your mileage may vary.

        you just want to see DFW's contributions, you can find all of them in
