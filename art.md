I like art - painting, sketching, and digital (i.e., drawing simple designs in
Inkscape). I'm not very good at improvising, though, so most of my works are
based on a photograph (CC-licensed or public domain where possible, but it
should fall under fair dealing in any case). I've tried to credit the original
source where possible, but some of the sources for my work are lost in the
browser bookmarks of laptops past. If you know the source for anything credited,
please [let me know!](/about#contact)

To see a higher-quality version of each thumbnail, just click on the photo (or
view the [imgur album][album], which also contains a couple more paintings which
didn't make the cut for this page). For the most part, the quality of the photos
is pretty bad. Unfortunately, I can't get any better-quality photos for most of
them &ndash; I no longer own the vast majority of my paintings, as I usually
give them away as gifts. In fact, for some of my paintings, I don't even have
photos of them at all.

<small>i guess they'll just be lost in time, like tears in rain</small>

dimensions from the dollar store. Completed on October 13, 2012 as a birthday
gift. As you can see, I really mangled the dimensions and colours for this one.

The sad story behind this painting is that I thought the blue stuff behind the
flower (which is actually purple in the original photo, but I didn't have the
right shade of purple) was a rock. Turns out it was a log. When I look at the
original now, it's so obviously a log. I probably hit my head on a rock or
something.

Source: a graphic that I think I found on 4chan (don't judge). Acrylic on
scrapbook paper. Completed sometime in 2010 because I was feeling melancholy
that day. The photo quality is awful, I know.

### There is a light that never goes out

uncertain size from the dollar store. Completed sometime in 2009. This photo
also has terrible quality. I'm sorry.

### Generic landscape

</a>

Source: no clue. Acrylic on a small canvas from the dollar store. Completed
sometime before 2009. The stuff on the sides is tape because I'm an idiot and
couldn't find a better way to stick the canvas onto the wall.

### Balloons

Source: original, for once. Acrylic on a tiny canvas from the dollar store.
Completed sometime before 2009. The stick figures were drawn with pen because
have you ever tried to draw stick figures with paint? It's not easy.

### Dewdrops

<a href="http://imgur.com/oi5KHqm">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oi5KHqml.jpg" class="large-thumb" />
</a>

Source: somewhere on Flickr (I've been trying to find the original for years but
I haven't been able to). Acrylic on a small canvas (I think 7" x 9") from the
dollar store. I think I painted this in December of 2008. This is widely (by
which I mean, among the few people I've shown this to) considered to be my
magnus opus, which is pretty sad if 1) you consider the fact that I painted this
almost 6 years ago (and thus clearly haven't really improved my craft since
then) and if 2) you notice all the places where I fucked up and was unable to
fix it. Like the purple smudge on the second dewdrop from the right. Or the
weird, nature-defying shape of the second dewdrop from the left.

This painting and I have a love-hate relationship. It's complicated.

[Source: Luz Adriana Villa on Flickr][moon]. Acrylic on a tiny canvas from the
dollar store. Completed sometime in 2008 or 2009. The colours are kind of washed
out compared to the original, and I'm not really sure why I decided to add
another bird. Also the moon looks like it's melting.

## Sketches

### Princess

</a>

[Source: a Vera Wang Princess ad (featuring Camilla Belle)][princess] that I
found in some magazine. Pencil on a huge piece of paper, using grid lines for
guidance. Completed in early 2008 for an art class assignment because I'm a
massive overachiever and I was obsessed with Vera Wang at the time. I fucked up
one of the eyes, though, so looking at her face is kind of terrifying. On the
bright side, the ruffles in the clothing around her arms are incredibly
detailed! (Prioritising is hard)

## Digital

Coming one day, maybe.
