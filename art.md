I like art - painting, sketching, and digital (i.e., drawing simple designs in
Inkscape). I'm not very good at improvising, though, so most of my works are
based on a photograph (CC-licensed or public domain where possible, but it
should fall under fair dealing in any case). I've tried to credit the original
source where possible, but some of the sources for my work are lost in the
browser bookmarks of laptops past. If you know the source for anything credited,
please [let me know!](/about)

To see a higher-quality version of each thumbnail, just click on the photo (or
view the [imgur album][album], which also contains a couple more paintings which
didn't make the cut for this page). For the most part, the quality of the photos
is pretty bad. Unfortunately, I can't get any better-quality photos for most of
them &ndash; I no longer own the vast majority of my paintings, as I usually
give them away as gifts. In fact, for some of my paintings, I don't even have
photos of them at all.

## Posters

I made these to hang on my wall (12" x 18"). Don't take them too seriously.
They're shitposts.

## Digital

When I was in my senior year of high school, my friend and I created an
embarrassingly cheesy series of webcomics that could be described as
"xkcd-inspired, but with a focus on melodramatic teenage problems and
littered with inside jokes that will certainly seem dated in a few years' time"
(The New York Times).

(That's a joke. It was never featured in The New York Times.)

I had a lot of fun with it, going so far as to do all the graphics in Inkscape
and build a PHP-based website that was visited by a few dozen people throughout
its lifespan, all of whom were my friends and most of whom could relate to the
banal teenage problems featured. The website has since been deleted, for
reasons that can probably be surmised, but I still have the graphics, so I
figured I'd put the least embarrassing ones on here.

### Tales From Mathematics

This one was supposed to be part of a series featuring various abuses of
mathematics, but I only ever made one. You can tell I was salty about something
here.

### Ash and Pikachu

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kgtXqbU.png" />

This one's actually one of my favourites &ndash; I really enjoyed making those vector
renditions of Pikachu and Waldo. Inspired by a true story, albeit one that does
not involve Pikachu, but does involve a healthy dose of salt.

### A Tale of Too Much Alcohol

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GTCI71S.png" />

Also inspired by a true story, or, more accurately, many true stories.

### Explorer

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QkLUAzw.png" />

A fun and unusually salt-free little drawing.

### Tales From Regular Physics

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/enBqA5c.png" />

There was supposed to be another series called "Tales From Astrophysics" but I
never ended up making it. There are only so many ways you can misappropriate
scientific concepts.

### Maybe It's Better

Presented without comment.

### Bad Ideas

The watermelon bowling thing happened to me while on a trip to a particularly
rural part of China. We managed to procure a whole watermelon but didn't have
anything to cut it open with, so we decided to forgo eating it and just use it
as a bowling ball instead. (There wasn't much to do in the area.)

Evidently, the watermelon had other plans, so we were able to enjoy a nice
snack of watermelon after a brief attempt at bowling.

### Themed Names

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/H0NBRwY.png" />

Making this one taught me a lot about: precious gems, Switzerland, nuts, and the
depths of human cruelty.

### Paper Cranes

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CzMKcfF.png" />

The weird story about this one (which is one of the only ones not inspired
by a true story &ndash; the idea just came to me one day when I was making
paper cranes) is that about two years after I posted it, I found an
[everything2 writeup][cranes] with an eerily similar theme.

### Plenty of Fish

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jSYAZyR.png" />

I had to bury that fish in the garden myself. It was a sad day.

### Another Fish

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/A13VpvK.png" />

True story. There were a lot of fish turnover issues that year. My CEO approval
rating on Glassbowl went way down.
