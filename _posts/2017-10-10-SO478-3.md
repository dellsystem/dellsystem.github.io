### Readings

#### [Towards a new politics of migration?](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2017.1300297) by Bridget Anderson

Written as a response to Stephen Castle's 2004 paper Migration Policies Fail,
in the context of the EU migration crisis of 2015. I thought this paper was
excellent.

* in short: migration policies fail because they are too
  shallow---they focus on numbers (symptoms!) rather than the root causes of
  migration
* so much money is spent on border technology, checks/raids, etc (symptoms)
* ofc the private sector manages to extract lots of profit from migration
  (and policies combatting it) in the meantime
* in the UK, esp among the working class, migrants can be seen as symbolic of a
  weakened nation state (and thus stronger business, transnational
  organisation interests)
  * Brexit = political success of a mission to scapegoat migrants
* Philip Hammond, UK Foreign Sec in 2010, quoted as saying that Africans come
  to the UK because life is better here
  * Anderson correctly points out that the reason life is better in the UK is
    partly due to resource extraction, pillaging, profits from foreign assets,
    etc (decolonialisation in name only)
  * goods are cheap in the North at the expense of the South
* anti-migrant rhetoric doesn't see migration as a structural problem, but
  rather as the choice of individual migrants (who then pose a threat to the
  national working class)
  * you also see complaints from "old" migrants about "new migrants", which
    has the effect of weakening solidarity and fostering divisions between
    potential allies :(
* we have to find a way to create solidarity between citizens and non-citizens,
  instead of dividing based on the perceived scarcity of material goods

#### [Global Inequality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27311800-global-inequality) by Branko Milanović (chapter 3)

On inequality among countries. basically the same as the paper from
last week (mostly methodology)

* we can separate out class-based inequalities from location-based inequalities
  (at least for the decomposable measures), weighted by population
* 1820s: 20% location, 80% class; by the mid-20th century, reversed (due to
  colonialism, mostly)
  * citing Bukharin: Second International supported WWI partly because colonial
    labour resulted in a better life for European workers (due to the huge
    amount of inter-country inequality)
* now: citizenship premium is very high which (along with, of course, many
  other factors) undermines the idea that capitalism allocates according to
  based on "merit" (since it so clearly relies on exogenous factors)
  * citizenship premium for the US relative to Congo (DRC or ROC?) is 93x; for
    Sweden to Congo, it's 71x; for Brazil, 13x; for Yemen, 3x (average)
  * if we instead look at the lowest decile: Sweden is 104x, Brazil 9x
  * top decile: Sweden 46x, Brazil 17x (which aligns with what we'd expect)
* we'd expect this to have an impact on migration patterns
  * egalitarian countries should expect more unskilled labour (if people made
    were informed about relative income distributions and made decisions solely
    on the basis of that ...)
  * ofc, to combat that, developed countries tend to have lots of policies in
    place to prevent unskilled immigrants from arriving---instead, they tend to
    get more skilled immigrants (which results in a really pernicious brain
    drain problem in their country of origin)
* the problem with a lot of our economic tools is that they were developed in
  an era when the nation-state ruled supreme and don't take into account the
  larger global context
  * for example: we rarely think of extending the concept of "equality of
    opportunity" beyond the confines of the nation-state
  * but now we need to consider migration, and capital flight, etc
  * problems with the [Coase Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem),
    which Milanovic describes as stating "that we can separate matters of
    economic efficiency from matters of distributional justice, essentially by
    relegating the latter to an area outside economic policy"
    * I need to understand the theorem a bit more but it seems like Coase
      specified various conditions that need to hold for the theorem to apply,
      and none of these conditions hold in the real world, which he
      acknowledged? so idk what the point of this theorem is except as a
      demonstration of how irrelevant a lot of economics work is
  * Q: should we even care about global inequality of opportunity?
    * Rawls said no, focus on rational self-determination, something something
      moral hazard (assuming citizens choose the fate of their own country)
    * apparently he thought intergenerational wealth was bad, but
      nationally-acquired advantages were good??? wtf
* tensions of migration
  * citizens can usually (at least theoretically) leave their own country, but
    may not always be able to enter another
  * globalisation means free movement of factors of production, not of labour
  * the right of individuals to make free economic decisions to maximise
    personal income vs global barriers preventing this
  * on the concept of development, which usually refers to increasing wages
    _within_ a country, without acknowledging the possibility of migration
    (which could have the effect of increasing wages for those from a
    particular country)
* 230m migrants in the world today (or 3% of pop) if we define it as people
  living in a country where they were not born
  * ofc, about 10% of this is attributable to the breakup of the Soviet Union
  * 700m (10%, or 13% of adults) WANT to become migrants (estimate I guess)
* Milanovic's proposals:
  * higher taxes for migrants (incl on remittances to "home" countries)
  * basically he thinks migrants shouldn't be treated equally under the law, at
    least for a while (we should codify discrimination rather than allowing it
    to exist in the shadows)
  * he presents essentially two opens: allow open migration but limit the flow,
    or, open up borders but add legal discrimination to discourage excessive
    migration

#### [Strategic Gendering](https://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781848443341.00012.xml) by Saskia Sassen

* on the invisible work of women in households
* sex-trafficking
* feminine industries (esp garments) in developing countries usually result in
  less worker empowerment, unions
* more women are entering workplace as professionals which results in the
  "disappearing wife"
* "immigrant women" as an "offshore proletariat"

### Lecture

Mostly facts and figures about migration. This lecture was given by [Diane
Perrons](http://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/people/people-profiles/faculty/diane-perrons),
Professor of Economic Geography and Gender Studies at LSE.

* graph from Milanovic showing country ventiles, Denmark vs Tanzania
  * poorest 5% in Denmark are usually richer than the top 5% in Africa,
    PPP-adjusted
  * obviously this illustrates the temptation to try to move away
* migrants are 48% female, with men more likely to be economic migrants (as
  opposed to due to catastrophe): 88% for M vs 44% for F
* if we look at migration between North and South:
  * South-South: 37%
  * North-North: 35%
  * South-North: 23%
  * North-South: 5$
* almost 20% of migrants live in the top 20 largest cities
* economic theories of migration:
  * neoclassical perspective: an individual response to differential wage rates
    that results in an equilibrating process
    * free movement of factors of production leads to equilibrium
    * factor flows respond to prices
    * labour goes from low to high wages (which is ofc not possible in practice
      except in a rare few cases)
    * capital goes from low to high returns
  * alternative theories: it's a disequilibrating process (inequality gets
    worse)
    * increasing returns to capital
    * colonial legacies (how does this fit in?)
    * brain drain
* on NAFTA: the primary goal was to give US corporations access to the Mexican
  market (as a place to dump goods)
  * this drove out local producers which reduced the supply of jobs locally
  * which then resulted in increased migration to the US 
* a more realistic economic theory of migration would include the following:
  * households may make decisions collectively (not always about individuals)
  * wage differentials are not necessary (like in my case)
  * some members of the household may remain behind if necessary
  * markets other than that of labour are also important
  * the shape of the income distribution & your position in it are also
    important (it's not just the raw, PPP-adjusted income)
  * access to social services, geographical features, political stability, etc
* Immanuel Wallerstein's world-systems theory is brought up! I'm a huge fan of
  Wallerstein and have been meaning his [World-Systems Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54909.World_Systems_Analysis)
  for a while
  * on the formation of the capitalist world market
  * labour flows in the opposite direction to capital
  * follows colonial legacies
  * reinforces uneven development
  * thus policies should focus on international capital/goods flow
* Saskia Sassen: remittances from migrant workers often exceed official
  development aid (for developing countries)
  * largest recipients of remittances: India and China (just because of
    population, not per capita)
  * in terms of GDP, it's Kyrgyzstan, then nepal
* the UN is working on a Global Compact on Migration for 2018
  * one of the action clauses is to reduce inequality within and between
    countries lol yes sounds good
  * sub-clause: facilitate orderly migration & reduce transaction costs to 3%
    (right now it can be as high as 7%---I think this includes costs of
    visas/transportation as well as remittances, relative to salary?)
* domestic work as a gendered form of migration: "global care chain" (term
  defined by Arlie Hochschild), where the children of a Filipina nanny in the
  US are taken care of by an even poorer woman
  * results in the erosion of the socioeconomic commons in the South
  * these workers are strategically necessary for the global city to function
  * really, they're a private means of coping with the global wage gap
    (individual solution to a structural problem)
* in the EU, the country with the highest proportion of non-nationals is
  Luxembourg (but that's just Eurocrats); most countries have very few
  * migrants tend to be disadvantaged, but long-term unemployment stats are
    lower than those for native-born
  * also second generation tends to do quite a bit better

### Seminar

Discussing Milanovic's proposal on migration. My own take is that by the point
you're talking about migration in terms of numbers and the policies of an
individual nation-state, you've already made a mistake. You're already on the
wrong level. It's equivalent to trying to solve climate change by buying
slightly more energy-efficient lightbulbs: an individual (in this case,
national) response to a structural problem. What we need is a fundamental
rethinking of the global economic system and its inequalities; otherwise,
migration will _keep_ happening. Setting quotas or imposing penalties or
closing borders is addressing the symptoms, and we can't let discourse on
migration be limited to that, otherwise it'll distract us from the real
problem: global inequality.

(My take is probably heavily inspired by a book that I happened to read just a
few days prior to the seminar: Slavoj Žižek's [Against the Double
Blackmail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751000-against-the-double-blackmail).)

Someone else brought up an interesting point about the impact of the automation
of labour on migration: as more and more jobs go away (at least in poorer
countries), there's more impetus to move to where the jobs still _are_.
