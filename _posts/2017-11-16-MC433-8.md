### Readings

#### [Redistribution or Recognition?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474666.Redistribution_or_Recognition_A_Political_Philosophical_Exchange) by Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth (chapter 1)

Only the first Fraser section was assigned, but the book seemed interesting so I just read the whole thing. I thought Fraser's sections were stronger overall (Honneth's sections kind of meandered in a way that made my eyes glaze over) but the book as a whole just felt a lot longer than it had to be. My notes are all on [Bookmarker](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/book/redistribution-or-recognition).

Main takeaways from this first chapter:

* we have to combine identity politics (recognition) and class politics (redistribution)
* the goal should be participatory parity, which requires both respect from peers & material resources
* a distinction between solutions to injustice that are purely affirmative vs those that are transformative (it's a spectrum)

#### [Barbara Van Schewick on network neutrality (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0cGw72pZRw)

Takeaway: ISPs should be regulated as common carriers! Nationalise em all (my words, not hers)

#### [Prohibition of discriminatory tariffs for data services (PDF)](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Regulation_Data_Service.pdf)

Released by the telecom regulatory authority of India in 2016. Relates to the whole [Facebook Free Basics debacle](http://mashable.com/2016/02/09/why-facebook-free-basics-failed-india/).

### Lecture

* on Fraser: we have to pair recog & redist; neither approach is individually sufficient
  * we can think of recognition as referring to: status/identity politics/institutionalised patterns of cultural value/making note of differences
  * whereas redistribution has to do with: class/socioeconomic disparity/abolishing differences
* on code as a way of regulating (when it comes to network neutrality)
  * Van Schewick is relevant here, though her approach (to code for regulatory) is different from Lessig's
  * in the original plans for the Internet (back when it was just a bunch of researchers using ARPAnet), there was no way to encode discriminating based on the type of data traveling
* arguments for an open Internet:
  * optimal way of fostering innovation
  * permissionless (no gatekeepers in the form of ISPs)
  * limits on overbearing powers of owners
* arguments against:
  * too absolutist (?)
  * prevents naturally-occurring corrective market behaviour
  * too much focus on content layer (instead of lower layer)
  * eradicates possibility of vertical integration and all the benefits that might bring (makes it harder for providers to move into emerging markets on the basis of efficiency gains)
* on India rejecting Facebook's Free Basics program
  * there's an excellent quote from egghead extraordinaire Marc Andreessen criticising the Indian govt for their decision
    * in response to a characterisation of the program as a technological extension of colonialism, he tweeted this:
    * "Anti-Colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades. Why stop now?"
    * gonna let that speak for itself
* conclusion: we should think of the architecture of the Internet not just in terms of access, but in terms of the production of innovation/justice
  * open Q: is an open architecture enough to get participatory parity? what else do we need to change?
  * (me: capitalism)

### Seminar

* I went on a bit of a tirade about diversity in tech as a very affirmative, identity-politics-limited strategy
  * this whole idea of representation might be a start, but it's NOT ENOUGH and you can't limit your focus to that
  * otherwise you just get Lean In Feminism
* someone asked how we can accomplish Fraser's suggestion of both affirmative and transformative solutions in a limited amount of time
  * (to which myself and another student both quietly said, "revolution")
* someone mentioned a proposal similar to Jaron Lanier's Who Owns The Future? (for which I wrote [an extremely negative review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2054329970?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)) that boiled down to micropayments from the tech giants to users
  * and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to deliver another, almost Leninesque diatribe about the dangers of that path
  * if anyone from my seminar is reading this, im sorry i just feel very strongly about this issue
* question about whether regulating the concentration of capital in the industry is the right approach
  * me: the _concentration_ of capital isn't the issue here---you can't just try to break up Google/FB etc and think 1) they'll acquiesce and 2) the problems won't occur again---the issue is the existence of capital _at all_
* an important point someone brought up: who's doing the regulating? will they take into account the concerns of marginalised groups?
