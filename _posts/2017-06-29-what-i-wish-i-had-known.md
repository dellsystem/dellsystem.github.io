This post is a very personal one, and a long one at that. It's been in the
making for a while, but I've been putting off actually finishing and publishing
it, partly because it's painful to write this stuff out and partly because I'm
afraid of alienating people who might not like what I have to say.

But dealing with pain and facing your fears--isn't that part of growing up? Part
of what it means to be human?

This is my story. If I don't tell it, no one will, and I can't let it wither
away inside my head.

***

The main reason I'm publishing this post now is that yesterday I read a post by
Tracy Chou on [why every tech worker needs a humanities education][quartz].
I already wholeheartedly agree with that premise, so I was inclined to like the
article before I even opened the page, but once I got to the first paragraph,
which mentions my favourite author, I was hooked:

> In 2005, the late writer David Foster Wallace delivered a now-famous
> commencement address. It starts with the story of the fish in water, who spend
> their lives not even knowing what water is. They are naively unaware of the
> ocean that permits their existence, and the currents that carry them.

She goes on to talk about how she wishes she had known about the value of a
liberal arts education when she was younger, which was like a balm for my soul,
since I feel exactly the same way:

> Ruefully--and with some embarrassment at my younger self’s condescending
> attitude toward the humanities--I now wish that I had strived for a proper
> liberal arts education. That I’d learned how to think critically about the
> world we live in and how to engage with it. That I’d absorbed lessons about
> how to identify and interrogate privilege, power structures, structural
> inequality, and injustice. That I’d had opportunities to debate my peers and
> develop informed opinions on philosophy and morality. And even more than all
> of that, I wish I’d even realized that these were worthwhile thoughts to fill

I'm publishing this post now because I want to share what _I_ wish I had known.
Before I found myself on a seemingly inescapable trajectory toward the tech
industry. Before I accepted a full-time offer at Google. Before I reneged on
that offer to rush into a startup instead.

I can't go back in time, but maybe it doesn't have to be that linear. Maybe my
writing this will make someone else examine and then change their trajectory.
Maybe my writing this will absolve me of the unexamined life I've lived for the
last few years. Maybe then it won't have been for naught.

Here's what this post is not.

This post is not about salary negotiation, or how to ace a tech interview, or
what programming languages you should learn. Those topics have been covered
extensively, and I have nothing constructive to add on those fronts.

Neither is it about how the tech industry is toxic, or filled with mediocre and
malicious people in seemingly unassailable positions of power, or plagued with
racism and sexism and other forms of institutional oppression. All of those
things are true to some extent, but that's all been covered in various other
posts and news articles recently, and I don't really have any stories that are
worse than what's already out there.

What I wish I had known before entering the tech industry isn't specific to the
tech industry. The problem isn't tech. The problem is something more systemic,
larger than even the tech industry, but (I think) you need to understand it if
you want to both be part of the tech industry and live an examined life.

This post is about water, and what I think it means to know what it is.

***

What I wish I had known is very tied up with my particular journey into tech. So
here's my journey.

All my life, I've felt like I needed something to work towards. Like I needed
something bigger than myself to give myself away to. A tragic case of heroism
without a cause, basically. I needed a cause worth fighting for.

I considered becoming a doctor, a lawyer, a UN peacekeeper. There was even a
brief period when I had this dream of joining U.S. law enforcement. I had it all
planned out: I would marry an American, then get my green card, then
naturalize, then join the FBI or the CIA or something and then finally I'd have
a cause worth devoting my life to.

I know, I know. It sounds so silly now. But I was young and the world didn't
seem to have that many causes anymore and I was searching for something that
would be worth the effort I wanted to put in. I was looking for something to
believe in.

I don't remember when I stopped looking for that something. I must have grown
out of that: that youthful idealism, that desire for something to strive for,
the naive hope that things really were black and white. I do know that when I
was applying to college, I felt like I was scrambling, lost, adrift in a vast
ocean of possibilities. I had no clue what I wanted to do, and so I latched on
to something that I felt I should do.

College brought with it a whole host of things I didn't expect. Initially a
physics and CS major, I soon found myself fully immersed in programming, with
a rapidly declining interest in physics. I was spending almost all my spare
time building software and very little time doing any metacognition about what
that signified. Eventually, I realised that I was firmly on a path to becoming
a full-time software engineer, without ever really choosing that path, or being
aware of what I was doing.

And for a time, the destination was motivation enough. I would read about tech
salaries, management styles, perks. I followed working software engineers on
Twitter and thought of them as role models, people whose lives I wanted. The
novelty of the industry and this path I found myself on was exciting enough that
joining this world seemed like an end in itself. In short, I bought into the
collective hallucination that is Silicon Valley.

The summer after my third year, I interned at Google in San Francisco and
managed to secure a return offer. When I returned to school for my last year,
people would ask me if I knew what I would do after graduation.

Yeah, I would say. I'm working at Google in San Francisco.

The response was almost inevitably something like: Congrats! That's amazing!
Are you excited?

To which I would usually say, Thanks! Yeah, I'm excited!

Or, if I was willing to be a bit more honest: I guess ... I mean, I just did an
internship there, and it wasn't that exciting. It probably won't be that
different when I'm there full-time.

Or, in those rare moments of radical vulnerability: I'm not, no. I'm really not
excited. Should I be? Is this really all I have to look forward to? Sitting at a
desk, writing code for a huge corporation I don't really care about? Is this
what I've been working so hard for? Is this it?

No one else knew, either.

When I look back at the way I used to think during this period, I inevitably
come up with the same few words, none of which are particularly flattering:
unconsidered. Narcisisstic. Trapped. On bad days, I would fall into this pit of
self-pitying despair about my future, thinking that it all just seems kind of
hollow. On good days, I would convince myself that I was so privileged to even
have this opportunity, that I was so lucky, that I should appreciate what I
have, that other people would _kill_ to be in my position.

But you can't live your own life by chasing other people's dreams.

In the face of this uncertainty, I turned inward in a bad way. I focused on
concrete, quantifiable things, like how many vacation days I would have, how
many tech conferences I could attend, how much I would earn after taxes. I
estimated my expenses to figure out how much money I would be able to save every
year. I found an apartment building I wanted to move in to and planned out what
unnecessarily expensive furniture I would fill it with. I started shopping for
dresses I would never wear, handbags I didn't need, shoes that have no purpose
other than to show how much money I was making.

All of this while avoiding the obvious question, the elephant in the room: for
what? To what end? Or is this already the end? Is this everything I've been
working for? Is it supposed to feel this empty?

Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and smack myself, make myself wake up.

Then along came the opportunity to start a tech company with people I knew in
Montreal. My own involvement was supposed to be temporary, in light of the fact
that I had already accepted a job offer at Google, but I kept pushing back my
start date until I eventually told my recruiter that I could no longer commit to
a date. This despite the fact that the startup was barely off the ground and our
prospects for success were, objectively, not great. Google would always be
there, I reasoned. At least, that's what I told others. On some level,
subconsciously, I think I was trying to escape a future that I knew I wasn't
ready for, a future I associated with cubicles and OKRs and the nagging feeling
of some stifling, mortal dread.

And so I threw out my lifeline and plunged headfirst into the startup.

Of course, that wasn't the answer either. We didn't have a clue what we were
doing. We were kids, playing at being entrepreneurs, flirting with risk and
challenge in our coddled little microcosm, dipping our toes in the ocean and
thinking that made us brave. But it was fun and challenging and new and for a
while that was enough. I found a cause that I could dive into, could sink to,
could devote myself to. Something that made me feel alive.

But it didn't last. Eventually, a voice in my head started asking: Why am I
doing this? I'm working this hard for what, exactly? To make the marketing
technology industry slightly more efficient? Is this a problem that I'm
passionate about? Honestly, is this a problem that _anyone_ is passionate about?

I was starting to understand that my foray into tech startups had nothing to do
with the product and everything to do with ego. I wanted to build a
challenging system so I could know what it was like to have built such a
system. I wanted the new experiences. I wanted the badge of honour. I wanted to
prove myself.

It wasn't about the product I was building. The product could have been
anything, for all I cared.

Here's the thing about startups. The escape that they represent is very
possible, but there's an enormous asterisk. Startups _can_ be a solution to
meaninglessness, futility, absurdity, alienation, the stereotypical
soul-crushing drudgery of the modern office job. _But_. Only if you are building
something you absolutely 100% care about.

Otherwise, the things that seem unfulfilling and troubling about a 9-to-5 aren't
resolved, they're just temporarily suppressed by the fact that you're in a more
uncertain environment with lots of other things requiring your attention. You
don't resolve the existential perils of an uninspiring corporate job by going to
a different company, or even by starting your own company. You can only truly
resolve them by the extremely difficult and painful task of figuring out who
_you_ are and what the hell you want to do with your life. In short, you have to
live an examined life.

I suspect no VC is going to tell you this when you ask them if you should quit
your job to do a startup. And for a good reason: it's not easy. It's not
something you do once and then tick off your checklist. It's a neverending
process. It's this horrific, Kafkaesque struggle to create a self, which of
course produces a self
[whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle][laughing].

You also can't do it solely by turning inwards. You have to understand the world
as well. You have to understand the water.

***

What do you think is the water you swim through?

For me, part of the answer to this question is something that I'm only just
starting to understand: capitalism. That all-encompassing world-order that feels
so eternal, so intrinsic to society, that it's hard to even conceptualise it.
You can see it so many different ways. Maybe it's this wonderful engine behind a
breathtaking amount of innovation. Maybe it's the creator of perverse incentives
that lead to some really mindboggling inefficiencies. Maybe it's cause of
humanitarian and environmental tragedies that could have so easily been avoided.
Maybe it's a dynamic system that's constantly being reinvented to keep up with
the times. Maybe it's a fragile tangle of internal contradictions that, through
its very functioning, will inherently bring about its own downfall.

Maybe it's all of these things, a wild, messy, ticking time-bomb that most
people never think about because it's seen as too fundamental to question.

But how do you _see_ it? How do you know what theories to trust? How do you
differentiate between what you believe by virtue of the world in which you grew
up and what is--to use a David Foster Wallace expression--the capital-T truth?
How can you truly understand anything in this absurd era of late capitalism
where everything is mediated and thus suspect?

I'll tell you how: by thinking for yourself. By exposing yourself to different,
even contradictory, ideas and having faith in your ability to synthesise the
truth. As someone who is currently trying to make up for a lack of a liberal
arts education, I recommend that if you still have the chance to do so, you
should seriously consider taking liberal arts classes. Take philosophy, English,
economics, sociology, political science, whatever looks interesting. Supplement
that by reading the writings of giants and treating them as shortcuts for your
own epiphanies. My personal recommendations, in no particular order, would be:
[Marx], [Rorty], [Camus], [Sartre], [Hegel], [Žižek], [Barthes], [Kierkegaard],
[Benjamin], [Harvey], [Jameson], [Kafka], [Rousseau]. Even [Ayn Rand], if you
have some large grains of salt at hand. And, of course, [David Foster Wallace].
Read whatever you can get your hands on and make up your own mind. Don't let
learning be a substitute for thinking; you will still need to evaluate whatever
you read on its own merits. Treat everything you learn as a potential but not
authoritative tool for better understanding the world you live in. (I'm actually
working on a post, targeted at programmers, on how to understand capitalism
better; if you read it, you'll have to walk a fine line between putting your
authorial trust in me and taking my advice in the previous sentence. I think you
should definitely put your trust in me, but of course, that's me talking.)

And look. Once you have a better understanding of the world-system, once you
really know what it means for you to get a job and get a mortgage and
raise a family, once you see how you fit in within the larger system of
capitalism, you start to see your options. You'll see that you don't necessarily
have to stay on the path that you're on now. That you have the tools to really
examine, to really _interrogate_ the path you're on and ask yourself why you
think it's the right one. That you can, if you so choose, make your own path.

Which is both liberating and terrifying at the same time: on the one hand,
you're free of your chains; on the other hand, _where the hell are you going to
go now_?

***

I feel like a lot of my friends in the corporate world are afflicted with
different strains of the same existential malaise. Most of the time, they're not
_really_ happy. They don't really feel fulfilled. Their job is challenging but
it feels kind of empty, somehow. They look at their boss and they think, Wow,
I really don't want that life. Something seems missing, but they're not sure
what.

But what can they do? They've been working there for a while now, and there's a
promotion coming around the corner, and then they'll make more money, and maybe
once they've saved up enough money to pay off any debts and take care of their
family and keep a nice cushion they can--what? Quit? Well, maybe not
immediately, but once they've figured out what they would rather be doing. And
in the meantime the chains get tighter and tighter.

True self-actualization is difficult to prioritise in a world that values you
according to how much capital you can accumulate.

***

I'm not writing this to try and tell you that you're living your life
incorrectly and that I know how you should be living instead. I don't, and only
you can make that call.

I just want you to remember one thing: that this is your life, right now. As you
sit in front of your computer, as the world spins on its axis, as Unix time gets
increasingly closer to calamity. What do you do day in, day out, is it. You are
ineluctably using up the finite number of days in that fleeting flicker that
will be your life.

I'm not trying to invoke despair here. I'm saying this for the sake of
liberation. Because if this is it, then you have to make sure that this is what
you want. Ask yourself if you're working toward something that's worthy of your
time. Ask yourself if perhaps there's an alternative path that's
more optimal in the ways that matter to you. Ask yourself if you're sure,
_really_ sure, that all the hard work you've put in so far and will continue to
put in is, in the end, worth it.

These are some of the toughest questions you can ask of yourself. And it pains
me that I can't answer them for you. I wish I could. I wish that I was writing
this post with a list of rules to follow and the sure knowledge that I was
right. I wish that I had been blessed with wisdom from on high, with the details
of a miraculous 12-step program and the promise of A Liberated Self Or Your
Money Back. I suspect that deep down, we're all desperate to give ourselves over
to something bigger than us: a cause, a job, a team, a family. Something.
Anything. A lit path to guide us as we stumble through life, bewildered,
disoriented, lost.

But I can't give you that. No one can. You have to make your own path. You
won't have any guiding lights, and it will be terrifying, and you will never
really know if you're going the right way, but that's the way you build a self.
It's the _only_ to build a self. It's the Sisyphean task that we've all been
assigned.
[Our endless and impossible journey toward home is in fact our home][laughing].

All I can do is tell you about my own path in the hopes that you'll find some
inspiration, some nugget of wisdom, something.

So here's what I'm doing now. In September, I'll be starting a [master's degree
in inequality at the London School of Economics and Political Science][msc].
I'm still not sure if I'll find what I'm looking for there--and, believe me, the
irony of forking over a significant portion of my life's savings in order to
study inequality is not lost on me--but I feel like it's a step in the right
direction. If you want to know why someone who used to think her exclusive
interest in STEM subjects was a badge of honour would ever voluntarily enter a
sociology department, take a look at [my personal statement][ps]. It feels very
dated now--I wrote it four months ago, which is really a lifetime ago given how
much I've changed lately--but one paragraph in particular still holds true:

> It is clear to me that the technology industry will change the world. It is
uncertain whether it will change it for the better. The exact nature of the
relationship between the technology industry and inequality is not a problem
that can be addressed without truly understanding inequality: its historical and
political context, its intersectional nature, its mechanisms of reproduction
within the greater structure of capitalism. There is a startling dearth of
attention being paid to these issues within the technology industry right now,
and my ultimate goal, after obtaining my degree, is to change that, either from
within the technology industry or without.

Or, more succinctly, as per [Tracy Chou][quartz]'s post:

> It worries me that so many of the builders of technology today are people
> like me; people haven’t spent anywhere near enough time thinking about these
> larger questions of what it is that we are building, and what the
> implications are for the world.

I believe that technology has the potential for radical, unprecedented change,
and that those of my generation who are working in tech are uniquely positioned
to direct this change. It's not going to be easy--it's going to require
a lot of people to wake up and decide, seemingly irrationally, that they want to
eschew the rules of the socieconomic system that pervades their lives. That they
want to make the effort to understand the world they live in and find something
worth fighting for in the process. That they want to go against the currents
that carry them.

I wish I had known that I could be one of those people. At least I do now. I
hope you do, too.
