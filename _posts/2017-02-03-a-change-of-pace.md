When I first created this blog -- almost six years ago, somehow -- I planned to
fill it with technical posts about projects I was working on and tips I'd
discovered. It only recently occurred to me that I, despite being a programmer
by occupation, could use my blog to write about things other than programming.
Which is silly, because it's not as if I had been born with a fully-formed
.vimrc file and an inability to form opinions on things that don't involve
code.

So let me remedy that.

***

I was born in China, and spent most of my childhood in Canada, but I'd always
wanted to move to the U.S. I'm still not entirely sure why. I do know that the
U.S. has always felt like the center of the world to me, and that I had a naive
admiration for what I thought of as American ideals. I'll even confess to a
belief in American exceptionalism despite having no real link to the U.S. Even
after gaining a more nuanced and critical understanding of American history
with the help of writers like Howard Zinn, even after I moved back to China and
found myself halfway across the world from U.S. soil, I still identified more
with the U.S. than I did with any other country. I followed American politics
with such zeal that I was probably more informed than most actual Americans.
Culturally, and politically, I was American; the fact that I wasn't one _de
jure_ was just a small obstacle to overcome.

Like many others in my generation, the first presidential election season I
was old enough to care about was in 2008, when a young Senator from Chicago
threatened to upset the political order by becoming America's first black
president. Imagine that! In a country whose legacy was stained -- from the very
beginning -- with the blood of black slavery, in a country that had ended
segregation only a generation before mine, there he was: a symbol of progress
made, and of progress to come. Even now, knowing that Obama's immediate legacy
will forever be associated with the rise of Donald Trump, I still get chills
when I watch his 2008 victory speech. If there's any validity to the idea of
American exceptionalism, the election of someone like Barack Obama might be its
most powerful testament.

My conception of America corresponded perfectly with the way Obama described
it: a land of democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope. And so when
his term limit came around and there was the chance that his successor would be
a _woman_ -- one who, though flawed, was still reasonably progressive, and was
certainly better than the alternative -- I was thrilled. Not just for
pragmatic reasons, although she clearly would have done a better job of
protecting women's rights and making life easier for would-be immigrants like
myself. But because it fit the narrative of the America I knew and loved, the
America that was slowly but steadily becoming more equal and just.

Now I understand that this America only ever existed in my head.

Over the last few days, I feel like I've lost so much time to the endless loop
that is my Twitter feed, knowing that each scroll will only bring fresh horrors
to deepen my misery but still unable to look away. If there's any consolation
to be found amidst the suffering, it's that it has ignited the capacity for
resistance in millions. That so many have been able to break through the
despair and start mobilising, fighting for the world they want rather than
accepting the one they have, gives me hope.

So maybe the America I fell in love with isn't that far off. It might not come
easily, but I suspect that the next few years will see an outpouring of
grassroots resistance, even more than what we've seen already. Stuck between a
party that wants to roll back civil rights and one that has a reputation for
being ineffectual and even corrupt, those who no longer believe in the status
quo have a chance to build something new. It won't be perfect, but what is?
Better incremental progress than a step backward. Better to light a candle than
to enable fascism in the dark.

Even if I no longer believe I will be part of it -- for immigration-related
reasons that will be the subject of another post -- America's inevitable
rebirth will be nothing short of spectacular, and I will feel so privileged
just to be able to witness it from afar.

For better or worse, this blog is the best embodiment of my digital self.
Certainly better than Twitter, because there's only so much you can communicate
about yourself in 140-character bursts. If I look back on what I've written
over the last few years, I don't see much to be proud of: some obscure
technical tips; descriptions of silly vanity projects I've worked on; a
data-driven foray into electoral politics in which I tried very hard to erase
all traces of being a human being with opinions. Lots of self-deprecating
asides. Using irony as a shield against the fact that I was not writing about
anything worth being earnest about.

The strange thing is, I never actually planned to go into software development.
Throughout high school, programming was a hobby I picked up because I liked the
idea of having something to work on in my free time. I never really thought of
myself as particularly good at it, though. Certainly not good enough to pursue
it full-time. When I applied to colleges -- and boy, do I regret spending so
much time applying to colleges; I lost an entire winter break answering a
seemingly neverending array of essay prompts -- I did so as a Physics major for
every school except McGill, which had a Physics and Computer Science major that
seemed reasonably interesting. The Computer Science part was the product of
convenience, more of an afterthought than anything else.

The thing that I liked most of all was _writing_. An early love of reading gave
way to an infatuation with words -- the way they sounded, the way they tasted,
the way you could arrange them in _just the right way_ to make the reader see
the world as you do, if only for a brief, tantalising moment.

But even teenaged me, I-only-know-PHP me, I'm-going-to-major-in-physics me
would soon see the way the wind was blowing. Software developers were the
future, not writers. The hard drives of laptops past are littered with
abandoned stories, poems, essays, plays. Whole worlds that I had created.
Forsaken to time and the pre-Dropbox digital ether.

Sometimes I miss it, you know?

There are some things about my adolescence that I regret. Hero-worshipping
people like Paul Graham, Eric S. Raymond, and moot. Revering The
Fountainhead to a level surpassed only by the likes of Paul Ryan, which, as far
as I can tell, is a [quasi-universal experience][aynrand]. Skipping school so I
could stay home and play RuneScape (and I never even maxed out any stats). But
the time I spent writing isn't one of them. If anything, I wish I had spent
more time reading, and writing, and seeking feedback on my work when I was
younger so that I might be a better writer today.

I'm not quitting the tech industry just yet, but I no longer believe that my
greatest contributions to the world will be limited to writing or discussing
software. Especially given everything else that's been happening recently. And
not just in the White House, either; it feels like we're on the cusp of a
global awakening, where more and more people are showing that they're unwilling
to accept the systemic flaws in our neoliberal world order, and are starting to
question the very foundations of capitalism.

Writing about something I learned while using MongoDB seems very insignificant
in comparison.

So here are some things I plan to write about over the next few months.

One major theme I want to explore is the idea of understanding complicated
concepts by breaking them down and approaching them from first principles.
You'll almost always end up with a deeper understanding of the original concept
that way. This is something I learned from physics, but you can apply this to a
variety of subjects: computer science concepts like regular expressions;
mathematical concepts like formal logic; social and economic concepts like
universal basic income, pensions, and money itself. What I'm talking about is a
bit like how Paul Lockhart wishes math would be taught in [A Mathematician's
Lament][lament], and a bit like [the "click"][dfw] that David Foster Wallace
mentions to describe his mathematical epiphanies. You don't _need_ to learn
automata theory to be able to use regular expressions, for instance, but if you
do, you'll have a much more fundamental understanding that will transform the
way you see them.

So many people are stuck with shallow understandings of important ideas because
they were taught to memorise their definitions, rather than to critique or
unpack or even think about for more than a second. Which is tragic, because the
result is often a set of erroneous conclusions. My plan is to write up as many
of these from-first-principles posts as I can. With any luck, I'll gain a
better understanding of the topic myself in the process.

Some other planned topics:

* American's immigration system and how it impedes would-be immigrants in
  myriad ways.
* How people resolve contradiction and ambiguity when forming their
  worldview. My favourite illustration of this -- and the inspiration for this
  post -- comes from Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, which I have rated five
  stars on Goodreads solely because of the inclusion of this theme.
* Reviews of various literary works (books, songs), as well as some meta-posts
  about the value of literary criticism as a whole.
* Certain not-so-flattering takes on the technology industry.
* Maybe some tech-related posts once in a while, just so that the time I spent
  deliberating on a syntax highlighting theme for this blog doesn't go to waste.

Now, I'll acknowledge that my blog isn't exactly a hotbed of activity. You may
be wondering ("you" being hypothetical here, as it's not clear that anyone will
ever read this post) why I would bother writing this post, much less any
of the other posts described above. I'm not an expert on any of the things I
want to write about; I don't know if what I have to say is original or
interesting in any way. I don't even have much of a platform, as I'm pretty sure
most of my site's traffic comes from bots.

The simple answer is: sometimes you just need to write. And that's all the
reason I need.
